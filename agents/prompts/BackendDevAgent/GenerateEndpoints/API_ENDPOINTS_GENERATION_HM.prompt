Below is the user story, it is delimited between triple backticks:
```
{user_story}
```

And below is the JSON schema of the endpoint:
```json
{json_schema_design}
```

For your reference and to eliminated the compile time errors, missing variables or missing/duplicate functions. I have added the database design in the form of model classes below:
```python
{model_classes}
```

Now, understand the above user story and the JSON schema, then write a function to fullfil the requirement. Make sure to import all the necessary modules, classes and functions to ensure the code runs successfully.

*IMPORTANT*: Your response should strictly start with "```python" and end with "```". And make sure not to include any instruction or comments, strictly Python code only.

Below code already exist in the `app.py` file. DO NOT REWRITE, RE-INITIALIZE or RE-IMPORT the existing modules, functions or variables. Just write the API function and import necessary modules related only to that function:
```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS
from database.models import get_session

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

session = get_session()

# ADD YOU TAKE ON FROM HERE, IMPORT AND GENERATE WHAT IS NECESSARY
```
