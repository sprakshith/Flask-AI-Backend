Below are all the Python imports, they are delimited between triple backticks:
```
{all_imports}
```

Now, analyze the imports and look for those which can be installed using `pip` and only extract those. There might be other imports which are local Python modules inside the project, ignore those.

*IMPORTANT*: Your response should strictly start with "```requirements" and end with "```". And make sure not to include any instruction or comments. Each installation required should be in a newline and do not add the versions.

Below is a hypothetical example:
```requirements
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
```
