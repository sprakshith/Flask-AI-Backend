Below is the first user story, it is delimited between triple backticks:

```
{user_story}
```

Now, understand the above user story and write a sql script to create tables to fulfil those requirements.

*IMPORTANT*: Your response should strictly start with "```sql" and end with "```". You should include all the `CREATE TABLE` statements related to the above provided user story without any instruction or comments, strictly SQL code only.

Below is an example of how your response should be:
```sql
-- CREATE TABLE statements here
```

If the user story doesn't have any database or table related details, then in that case respond with empty SQL code like shown below:
```sql
-- NO TABLE DETAILS
```
